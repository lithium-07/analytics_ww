Use uvicorn main:app --relaod to run it locally.

This will need a gcp-cred.json file to connect. This file can be obtained from:
console.cloud.google.com -> api and services -> credentials

You will have to create credentials if they are not present and then download them as json
(credentials should be generated for a service account)
